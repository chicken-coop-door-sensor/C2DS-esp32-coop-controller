### Overview of the Coop Controller Code and Its Capabilities

The Coop Controller is an ESP32-based system designed to monitor the status of a chicken coop door and communicate this status via AWS IoT services. Here's a breakdown of its capabilities and how it works, suitable for an introductory audience.

#### Main Components and Structure

1. **ESP32 Microcontroller**: The core hardware that runs the controller's firmware.
2. **Optocouplers**: Sensors used to detect whether the door is open or closed.
3. **LED Indicators**: Provides visual status of the door (open, closed, or error).
4. **MQTT Protocol**: Used for communication between the controller and AWS IoT Core.
5. **AWS IoT Core**: Manages the IoT devices and handles message routing.
6. **AWS Lambda**: Executes specific functions in response to IoT events.
7. **DynamoDB**: Stores the state and other relevant data.

#### Code Structure

The codebase includes several key directories and files:

1. **Main Application Code** (`main/`):
   - `main.c`: The main application logic.
   - `sensors.c` & `sensors.h`: Functions and definitions related to sensor operations.
   - `certs/`: Directory containing security certificates for secure communication.

2. **Configuration Files**:
   - `CMakeLists.txt`: Build configuration for the project.
   - `sdkconfig`: Configuration settings for the ESP32.

3. **AWS Integration**:
   - Scripts and configurations for integrating with AWS services.
   - MQTT topics for communication.
   - Certificates for secure connection to AWS IoT Core.

#### Capabilities

1. **Sensor Reading**:
   - The controller reads the state of the coop door using optocouplers.
   - It detects three states: open, closed, and error.

2. **Status Communication**:
   - The controller publishes the door status (`OPEN`, `CLOSED`, or `ERROR`) to the MQTT topic `coop/hardware/signal`.
   - It subscribes to the `coop/status` topic to receive status updates and set the local LED accordingly.

3. **Visual Indicators**:
   - An LED on the controller provides a visual status of the door.
     - **Green**: Door state is as expected (open during the day, closed at night).
     - **Flashing Red**: Error state (door open at night, door closed during the day, or sensor failure).

4. **AWS Integration**:
   - The controller uses AWS IoT Core for communication.
   - AWS Lambda functions handle decision-making based on door status and time of day.
   - DynamoDB stores the current state and sunrise/sunset times.

5. **OTA Updates**:
   - The controller can receive over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates via AWS S3 buckets.
   - It subscribes to the `coop/update/controller` MQTT topic for OTA update triggers.

#### Error Handling

The system is designed to handle several error conditions:
- **Door Closure Failure at Sunset**: If the door does not close at sunset, an alert is triggered.
- **Door Open Failure at Sunrise**: If the door does not open at sunrise, an alert is triggered.
- **Missing Keep-Alive Messages**: Indicates a controller failure if messages are not received within a specified period.
- **Sunrise/Sunset Times Retrieval Failure**: Triggers an alert if the system cannot retrieve these times.
- **Status Disagreement Between Sensors**: Indicates a potential sensor or connectivity issue.

#### Setup and Operation

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Configure the ESP32 with the appropriate firmware.
   - Set up AWS IoT Core, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB tables.
   - Deploy security certificates for secure communication.

2. **Normal Operation**:
   - The controller continuously monitors the door status.
   - It publishes the status to AWS and updates the local LED indicator.
   - AWS services process the status and trigger alerts if any issues are detected.

This system ensures the safety and security of the chickens by providing real-time monitoring and alerts, without requiring manual intervention once set up.
